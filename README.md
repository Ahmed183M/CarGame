# CarGame
A game that I made while I was bored!
Added new cheatcodes and made a few changes in version 2.0!

The Car Game!
Instructions:

    1) You have three gears to choose from.
    2) The first gear (Gear 1) will make the car move 10 pixels per button press. And the car will consume 1 liter of fuel per movement.
    3) The second gear (Gear 2) will make the car move 20 pixels per button press. And the car will consume 0.75 liter of fuel per movement.
    4) The third gear (Gear 3) will make the car move 30 pixels per button press. And the car will consume 0.25 liter of fuel per movement.
    5) After you choose a gear use the "D" keyboard button to move the car towards the finish point.
    6) Reach the finish line without running out of fuel!
    7) Refresh the browser to start a new fresh game.

Some Restrictions:

    ~You MUST start with the first gear and use it for 5 movements!
    ~You can only win if you have used the second gear for 5 movements!
    ~You can bypass these restrictions if you know the first cheat code!
